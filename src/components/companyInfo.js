Bot and Website Usage Guide:

BOT USAGE: Flexible & Tiered for Value
The bot is still in early development, but here's the big picture of how it can be leveraged:

You Can Decide How to Use It:
- Premium Add-on: Offer the bot only to paid subscribers.
- Daily Analysis: Use it to provide chart insights or trade setups daily.
- Customizable: Give feedback to improve itâ€”tailored to your use case or community's needs.

Tiered Structure for Users (Example via tcasia.guru):
- Free Tier:
  Anyone visiting https://tcasia.guru/brolysis can try the bot.
- Subscriber Tier:
  Paid members (like BroBam) get more features or analysis.
- RoboForex Trader Tier (In development):
  Traders using RoboForex may get integrated TradingView signals.
- Guru / Dedicated IB Tier:
  Fully customized bot experience:
    - Custom indicators
    - Own language
    - Specific instruments or strategy

Bottom Line:
"The bot is just a tool. It depends on how you package it to add value."

If you don't have a website ready yet, a simple MVP version has been created for you:
https://market-landing-gen.lovable.app/
This can serve as a temporary base until you fully develop your own platform.

TL;DR:
- You can use the bot however fits your community best (premium feature, content engine, tool for engagement).
- There's a 4-tier model showing different levels of access based on user type (Malaysia example, funnel yet to be completed).
